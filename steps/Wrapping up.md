Quick recap
=====================
Variables store information for later. We used variables to store things like our monster's element and its nickname.

Functions are pieces of code that can be called from other parts of the program. We wrote functions that are automatically called when a specific event happens: **Handlers**. In those functions, we called functions that had already been written for us from **Libraries**. We made functions to set up our monster (```setupMonsterStats```) and handle button presses (```tackleButtonPress``` and ```elementalButtonPress```).

If-then-else statements allow our code to react to things. We used one to check if our elemental move would work against our opponent. If it would, we used it but if it wouldn't we used tackle instead.

For-loops allow code to be repeated. We added a for-loop to use the Tackle a random number of times in a row.

Congratulations!
================
You've done it! You have coded your own monster and won three battles. In the first battle you learned how to call a function from a **Library**. In the second battle you learned how to use if-then-else statements. In the third battle you used a for-loop. These basic concepts are the core of all programming languages. Congratulations -- you have just begun your journey as a programmer!


If you still have time...
================

We have one more battle for you: harder than the rest! You are going to need to use everything you have learned to defeat *this* monster. If you have managed to finish early, continue on to see what we have in store for you...
