So, what is a class anyways?
============================
We've got one more thing to go over before we finish. The first of the code we gave you, ```class MyMonster: Monster {```, tells the computer we are defining a new class called ```MyMonster```. The ```: Monster``` after means that ```MyMonster``` inherits from ```Monster```. But what does this all mean?

A class is a special way to break up ideas into code. In this game we have a ```Monster``` class. This class hold all the information necessary for a monster to exist. It organizes a ```Monster```'s variables and methods in a way that is easy to understand and reusable. It's so reusable that when we write ```MyMonster```, we choose to inherit ```Monster```'s code. This means you did not have to write methods to handle being attacked, losing health, and all the other things we handled for you.

Congratulations!
================
You've done it! You have coded your own monster and won all three battles. In the first battle you learned how to call a method. In the second battle you learned how to use if-then-else statements. In the third and final battle you used a for-loop. These basic concepts are the core of all programming languages. Congratulations -- you have just begun your journey as a programmer!
